# Content Publishing

Alike other systems, publishing to stage and live is done via branch management. Thus, you can assign one branch to be your staging branch, and another to be your live branch.
After master branch's code is fully tested and stabilized, you can merge it to live branch.

- For GitHub repository merging, follow the [Branching](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848).
